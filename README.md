## Hello! üëã 
## Welcome to our GitHub repository.

On this website, we provide the code of our study entitled **‚Äú‚Äù**. This algorithm was built to provide real-time biofeedback of cognitive effort during golf putting practice using a custom low-cost eye-tracker. 
The code reads real-time data from four low-cost USB cameras to compute pupil dynamics, putting performance, and putting biomechanics. The system provides biofeedback of an optimal mental state (optimal cognitive effort level) to an experimental group (biofeedback group) during golf putting based on a reinforcement learning algorithm. This algorithm was trained with a 24 individuals‚Äô dataset of each performing 100 putting strikes. The codes from both biofeedback system and biofeedback threshold identification (reinforcement learning) are available in the ‚Äúprojects‚Äù section.
