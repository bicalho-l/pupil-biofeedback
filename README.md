## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 
## Welcome to our GitHub repository.

On this website, we provide the code for our study titled **The use of an Artificial Intelligence system to optimize motor learning via cognitive effort biofeedback**. This algorithm was developed to offer real-time biofeedback of cognitive effort during golf putting practice using a custom low-cost eye-tracker. The code reads real-time data from four low-cost USB cameras to calculate pupil dynamics, putting performance, and putting biomechanics. The system provides biofeedback of an optimal mental state (optimal cognitive effort level) to an experimental group (biofeedback group) during golf putting, based on a reinforcement learning algorithm. This algorithm was trained using a dataset of 24 individuals, each performing 100 putting strikes. The code for both the biofeedback system and biofeedback threshold identification (reinforcement learning) is available in the "Projects" section.
